### Research Associate, Automotive Services and Communication Technologies
<strong> Fraunhofer Fokus </strong>
<strong> Berlin, Germany (Nov. 2019 - Present) </strong>
- Developing perception algorithms for self-driving vehicles using Lidar and Image data
- Building deep learning models for 2D/3D object detection of traffic participants, lane and road marking detection, traffic sign detection
- Working on perception algorithms for autonomous shuttle <a href="https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/asct/shuttlesco" target="_blank">Shuttles&Co</a>, and reconfigurable hardware platform and associated software framework for autonomous driving chip project <a href="https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/de/asct/projekte/ki-flex" target="_blank">KI-FLEX</a>
- Supervising a master thesis student for Deep learning based motion forecasting, supervised 11 students for 5 group projects (pole \& building facade detection using point cloud, multi object tracking and segmentation) 

### Student Assistant at Dynamic Vision & Learning Group, TU Munich
<strong> SUPERVISOR: PROF. LAURA LEAL-TAIXE, DR. JAN DIRK WEGNER (ETH ZURICH) </strong>
<strong> Munich, Germany (Dec. 2018 - Mar. 2019) </strong>
- Applied methods developed during master thesis on Breast Cancer Dataset to predict count and size histogram of malignant cancer cells
- Fine-tuned our model using object count and size histogram as intermediated results and improved cellularity score prediction
- Submitted a research paper, ”HistoNet-Predicting size histograms of object instances” in a Computer Vision conference

### PreciBake GmbH - Working Student at AI Department
<strong> Munich, Germany (Aug. 2017 - May. 2018) </strong>
- Modeled and trained Deep Learning architecture for predicting tray motion, tray level and for classifying product from outside and inside of the oven for automatic baking program selection
- Exploited temporal patterns with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU) for the estimation of thickness of the product, baking time estimation and product recognition using input video data and sensor data as in intermediate input
- Collected cleaned and pre processed various type of data (i.e videos , images, time series sensor data); Analysed sensitivity of multiple sensor data on the performance of model prediction to reduce the product cost
