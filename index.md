I Kishan Sharma, have been working as a research associate at Automotive services and communication technology group, Fraunhofer Fokus, Berlin for about 1.25 years. My skills and interests lie at the intersection of Computer vision and Deep learning fields. I am currently developing deep learning based perception algorithms for self-driving cars, including object detection, tracking and segmentation using camera and lidar based sensors.
    
I did M.Sc in Computational Science and Engineering with focus on Computer vision and Machine learning from Technical University of Munich, Germany with a GPA of 1.5/1.0. I have successfully completed my master thesis “HistoNet: Predicting size histograms of object instances ” at ETH Zürich with a grade point of 1.0, which resulted into a publication at WACV 2020 conference <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Sharma_HistoNet_Predicting_size_histograms_of_object_instances_WACV_2020_paper.html" target="_blank">[Link]</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.prs.igp.ethz.ch/content/specialinterest/baug/institute-igp/photogrammetry-and-remote-sensing/en/group/people/person-detail.html?persid=186562" target="_blank"> Dr. Jan Dirk Wegner </a>
(ETH Zurich) and  <a href="https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Laura Leal-Taixe </a>(TUM). I have completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of technology, Jodhpur in 2015. The rapid advancements in the field of Computer vision challenges me to learn fast, adapt and enhances my problem-solving skills.
